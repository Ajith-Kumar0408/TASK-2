DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCUMENT AND WINDOW OBJECT:

•	When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object. The document object is a property of the window object. 

•	The window object represents the browser window. The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.

•	Document Object: The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.

•	With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
              Syntax:
                      document.property_name;

•	Window Object: The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.

•	Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.
              Syntax:
                      window.property_name;

	DOCUMENT

•	It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.

•	It is loaded inside the window.

•	All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.

•	We can access the document from a window using the window. Document

•	The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model).

	WINDOW OBJECT:

•	It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   

•	It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser

•	Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

•	We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

•	The window is part of BOM, not DOM

•	Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
